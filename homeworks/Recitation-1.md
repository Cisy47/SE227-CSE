## Question 1

> How to explain the idea to one of your friends whose major is not computer/software?

Lisp is a great language with a lot of excellent features. However, it is not so successful and popular as c/C++ because the standardization of Lisp is of *the right thing* approach instead of * worse is better* approach. The *worse is better* approach emphasizes on simplicity and can be spread fast as virus. If the Lisp takes *worse is better* approach to realize several features, it will finally be successful.

## Question 2

> Which contexts does "worse is better" suitable for? Which contexts doesnâ€™t ? 

In the area which community is more important than correctness, such as programming language, *worse is better* is suitable. More users can result to more application and more extensions. While in the situation where correctness is much more important than community, such as medicine, *the right thing*is more fit.

## Question 3

> Please describe one of your own projects, and think whether "worse is better" is suitable for it.

In the summer vacation project, which we need to write a game, *worse is better* is suitable. I should at first make a simple but interesting one. And then, with larger popularity, more features can be added later.

## My Own Questions

- What if the first simple version has too many bugs and screw everything up, so that users do not want to see it any more? Is *worse is better* still be suitable in such situation?

- How can we deal with the incompatitivity brought from endless updating?
